## Version 7.0.34 - 2024-05-29

- Fixed bug (#231) related to file templates on "Advanced" screen (again).  Related changes:
    - You can enter multiple file templates, separated by commas.
    - If you do not enter a file extension, the "normal" list of file extensions (appearing on same screen) is used.
    - If you use '*' as the extension, GF may be bogged down searching files not of interest (such as text files created from binaries, or bak files).
- Bugs fixed:
    - Sorting on full path of file name.
    - Elapsed time was not including time to save results.

## Version 7.0.33 - 2024-05-25

    - Elapsed time for Custom UDF execution was not being captured correctly.

## Version 7.0.31 - 2024-05-12

- Added new Scope option "Results" to search only the files in the current Results set, that is, the files currently shown in the grid and Treeview (same list in both places), instead of those in the scope folder or project.
- Added new Scope option "Custom UDF" to provide for the use of a custom UDF to generate the list of files to be searched (instead of files in the scope folder or project).  See [this FAQ Item](FAQ.md#CustomUDFScope).

## Version 7.0.30 - 2024-05-04
