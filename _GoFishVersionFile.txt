## Version 7.0.17 - 2024-03-23

* Multiple identical results were occurring for matches in MNXs using regular expressions (#190).
* Scope setting "Search All Projects" was not working if projects were not all in the same folder (#188)
* MRU list for search dropdown was misbehaving under some conditions (#187)
* The "Advanced" form has been simplified and shows only those options not already appearing on the main form.

## Version 7.0.16 - 2024-03-18

Notes on the previous version (7.0.15) were over-confident about being able to eliminate the problem of files hitting the 2G limit. There has been significant progress in making these problems exceedingly unlikely and this update is one more step in that direction, but it is not possible to promise they will never occur again.

## Version 7.0.15 - 2024-03-17

* Remove redundant (and confusing) display in Code View pane for matches in MNXs (#184)
* Modify use of memo fields in the results grid to eliminate the error when the FPT file exceeds 2G limit. (#49, #158). As this was achieved by removing some no longer needed code, there is an imperceptible speed improvement as well.

## Version 7.0.14 - 2024-03-15

* Code View pane changes:
    * The "Code Browser zoom factor" spinner has been removed from the Options form, as it wasn't working. (#179)
    * A new spinner, "Code View pane font size (px)" has replaced it. See Options form, "New in Version 7".
    * If option "Use IDE colors in Code View pane" is **not** selected, users may supply their own css file, named `HOME(7) + '\GoFish_\GoFish_.css'`
* Bug fixes:
    * Buttons to select project or search folder (to right of the scope combobox) not working (#178).
    * Unable to replace in MNXs (#180).
    * Error: file `gf_search_history` not found. (#181, #126, #80)

## Version 7.0.12 - 2024-03-10

* Fix for issue #27, where Code View pane does not always auto-align the match line to be visible.  See Options form, "New in Version 7".

## Version 7.0.11 - 2024-03-09

* Two bug fixes related to the new Search Mode combobox

## Version 7.0.10 - Major version update - 2024-03-08

# Major Enhancements
* Wildcard searching now finds matches across continuation lines. (#67)
* "Whole Word" searching now applies to each word in the search phrase in wildcard searching.

# Code View pane enhancements
* The Code View pane emphasizes the entire statement (that is, including continuation lines) instead of just the line where the match occurred:
    * The entire statement is enclosed in a red box.
    * All matches in the statement are highlighted.
* Colors in the Code View pane match the user's own colors in IDE code windows. (Experimental) - (#89)
* The Code View pane for matches in MNX files has been enhanced to be more descriptive, showing the `Prompt`, `Command`, `Procedure`, and `SkipFor` fields for the match. (#87)

# Other enhancements
* New feature for editing MNXs: Double-clicking on a match in an MNX (`Prompt`, `Command`, or `Procedure`) now opens the MNX to that exact row for editing. (Experimental)
* The "Code Only" checkbox filter has been enhanced to find matches in some places previously ignored. It now also includes code matches found:
    * In #Define statements
    * In MNX files in `Command`, `Procedure`, or `SkipFor` fields
    * In FRX files in `Field` records (`ObjType = 8`)
* In the History form, sort on columns by clicking column headings.
* When upgrading from version 5 to version 7 (#151):
    * the search and history files for version 5 are no longer removed, so version 5 and GF Classic will still work.
    * however, the search and history files are not imported into version 7.
* If regular expression search is chosen and the search expression doesn't contains special characters for regular expressions, use plain search instead (#152).

# New UI elements
* New combobox for Scope Mode (top left of main screen)
   1. Active Project
   2. Browse Project
   3. Current Directory
   4. Browse Project
   5. All Open Projects (With only one project open, this is the same as "Active Project")
* New checkbox filter "Comments Only". (#150)
* Two new links at bottom left:
    * Issues page in GitHub for GoFish
    * Change Log page in GitHub for Gofish
* New options (See Options form >= Preferences)
    * Use IDE colors in Code View pane
    * Projects and folders in the scope dropdown may be alphabetized
    * Column 'File Name with Path' may show a relative path
    * Code view pane highlights only the match line (not the entire statement)
* Right-clicking on node in TreeView copies the file name (full path) to the clipboard. (#114)

# Project Explorer Integration
* If Project Explorer is open, uses it to open files for editing so that Project Explorer can handle things like calling FoxBin2PRG after closing an edited file.   (#154)
* 'All Open Projects' added to the new Scope Mode combobox. Useful when using Project Explorer, which opens and hides all projects in a solution.  (#156)

# Restored Features
* Restored the previous setting (GF v5 and earlier) such that selecting 'Active Project' from the scope dropdown is a permanent setting, so that if GF is next opened with a different active project, that project becomes the scope. #137
* Restored feature from  (GF v5 and earlier) that kept the controls at top right from moving all the way to far right (visible only when form is sufficiently wide.) - (#105, #155)

# Bug fixes
* In Filter Builder, misleading "Match Anywhere" checkbox has been removed.  (#9)
* Line/column numbers in status bar now update properly when the code window is opened from GoFish or after GoFish closes (#77, #157)
* When the match is to a file name of a text file (such as a PRG), the Code View pane shows the text correctly.  Previously the beginning text was lost. (#90)
* With Version 6 options enabled, it had not been possible to type or paste anything into the Scope combobox. (#122, #123)
* Crash on Replace (#148)
* Bug reported when changing Desktop checkbox (#162)
* Settings on Options/Colours page were not taking effect (#163)
* Restoring latest search (from "History button context menu) was not always selecting the *latest* search.
* Janitor not working properly, was improperly related to scope; setting is actually a global setting independent of scope.

# Under consideration for future
* If Project Explorer is open, uses it to open files for editing so that Project Explorer can handle things like calling FoxBin2PRG after closing an edited file.   (#154)
* Simplifying the "Advanced" form by removing from it any option already visible on the main screen.
